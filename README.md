A Java-based data analysis application that ingests datasets, processes them, and generates analytical insights for end users.  
This project demonstrates Java programming concepts such as **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction**, as well as integration with data processing workflows.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project consists of several modules:
1. **Data Ingestion** (`Data_Ingestion.java`) – Handles loading of raw data.
2. **Data Analysis** (`Data_Analysis.java`) – Performs analytical operations, applies a predictive model, and prepares data for visualization.
3. **Data Cleaning** (`Data_Cleaning.java`) - Handles cleaning and preprocessing of raw data.
4. **Data Visualization** (`Data_Visualization.java`) - Dashboards designed to get insights from patients data.
5. **Machine Learning** (`Machine_Learning.java`) - Machine learning algorithm that is used to predict if a new patient has diabetes or not.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Java SE** (Core Java Concepts)
- **Collections Framework**
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP)
- **Data Parsing** (CSV/Excel parsing possible)
- **Custom Predictive Model Implementation**

## 🚀 Features
- Reads and processes structured datasets.
- Cleans and transforms raw data for analysis.
- Applies basic predictive analytics logic.
- Outputs results ready for dashboard visualization.
- Demonstrates modular Java application design.
